I have a dataset which contains data and performance from my third party marketing partners. I hold weekly meetings where I create a Microsoft Powerpoint Presentation. As I have added many partners, it is now very time consuming.

I am looking for a way to automate this process in a clean, and flexible way. I have all of the data available in a spreadsheet which I update each day. That will be the source file.

I am looking to put this data into a presentation, which would auto generate the charts and be able to filter daily, weekly,  monthly, or a specific date range.

I would also like to be able to filter by marketing partner, or look at it with all of them combined.

I'd like to use KPI's -  Key Point Indicated - such as CPA, Conversion Rate, and a few other metrics to generate these charts. This information will be in the source file.

Summary: I am looking create an automated data visualization process of the performance of my multiple marketing sources, which could be used in as a clean and good looking presentation. All information is in one file, in a neat, organized order. I would like the ability to filter by source and by a date range, and the ability to highlight certain KPI's. The main purpose is for presentation but if it could also be used as a tracking method, or other data visualization purpose, that would be great also. Any platforms/software recommendations are acceptable, I'm not set on any one in particular. Looking for a quick completion time on this.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you
