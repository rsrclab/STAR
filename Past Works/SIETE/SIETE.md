SIETE team offered us some tasks for SIETE OLAP dashboard.

SIETE OLAP(online analytical processing) relies on on Google Cloud Datawarehouse.

## about team
In our team, there were 4 main developers.
designer, react engineer, backend develper, etc.
With my skills as data engineering, I workd as a data engineer and QA engineer in this project.

# Task
My responsibilites included fixing and updating minor databases, SQL optimization, 
and next, reporting automation.
Mainly my role was reporting automation.

# Action
(video, excel, code)
Then Let me explain my works detail
*One second.*
I made some videos for reporting at the end of the development.
*One second.*
*Okay. here.*
First let me explain this video.

## video1 & database design
As you can see here, There are many databases.
*info, inveotory, products, sales and so on.*
As you can see here, There are so many things.
*database names...*
This is SIETE Google Cloud Datawarehouses in SIETE OLAP.
Due to many relations between products and sales database, I also updated 'products' database.
*in_stock_sales, out_of_stock, store_locator, and so on.*
I mainly maintained and updated 'sales' database in this datawarehouse.
*sales, sales report, ...*
And I also updated 'products' database because 'products' and 'sales' have many relations.
*out_of_stock, ...*

## code view sql
With updating database I also optimized SQL using BigQuery.
Here are some of my works while optimizing BigQquery statements.

## video2
Second was reporting automation.
As I said, SIETE is the world-wide famouse food company in the world.
There transactions and reporting data works on top of Google Dataware house.
Through OLAP dashboard, they get information and make or update strategy of company.
Invest Market and sales, find the efficient way to enhance the sales and marketplace.

Before SIETE team detect the failure points or unnormal problems with detail-oreiented eye thorugh this tables and charts.
Of course these are good reports.
By repeating the reprots they need to report fast.
Their requirements were....

## code
I implemented this Reporting automation using python, panda, numpy and so on.
I integrated Google Cloud datawarehouse and Google Drive.
I imported datas from Google cloud datawarehouse using BigQuery.
and convert them Panda's data.
After this, There are so many computations like
-how
-
panda is an efficient python library to make all of them in timely manner.
My expertise in python, panda, and Gogle Cloud platform were extremely useful. and made it.
Here are my code.

# Result

As a result, My works created and updated excel files automatically withouth eyes.
Reporting automation analyzed sales data, transaction data, marketing infromation and lots of information on top of Google Cloud Datawarehouse.
even though their eyes are detail-oreinted and anlaytical someties they have some faults.
Thanks to my implemenation of reporting automation, They can work more easily
and They are very satisifed about our work.
