Course Overview
Master the JavaScript interview by practicing 20 carefully curated interview questions and solutions. 
These problems will provide the tools you need to tackle any question you find in an interview. Allow ~1 hour per question.
Most questions have multiple solutions presented. All solutions are thoroughly explained and time and space complexity are discussed. 
A passing familiarity with these ideas is expected. You'll learn how to tackle different types of problems so you can proceed with confidence in your interviews.

These questions go beyond the common problems that we've all seen. FizzBuzz and bubble sort? We start past those.
We'll discuss how to refine algorithms. We'll go over clever, advanced ways of manipulating data that interviewers are looking for. 
You'll walk away more skilled and confident in your problem solving and interviewing abilities.
This course is taught in ES2015.
