## Proposal
Hi, Kirill. How are you?
This is Daniel who is genuinely interested in your company.
It's really motivating because my skills match your requirements perfectly.

Then let me explain my technique through one of my works.
My clients and colleagues have been satisfied when I have been involved in SIETE data warehousing and reporting automation.
Thanks to my skills in Pandas, Spark, React, Node.js, and GCP, I was a key member of this project.
After completing the project, the client requested reporting automation.
It wasn't my job and I was too busy with other projects.
However, there were no candidates for automating reporting using python, GCP, or pandas.
So I volunteered to do it and finished it perfectly on time, even though I was busy with another project.

In a nutshell
I excel in
- Python, Javascript(ES6+), Typescript, SQL
- RDBMS, SQL optimization, OOP, Functional programming
- Pandas, Spark, React, Vue.js, Node.js
- GCP, Blcockhain, MongoDB

I am familiar with Jira, Trello, Linear and Slack very well and have a good team mind and customer/client focused mindset.

I'd like to work with innovative ones like yours and furthermore take an opportunity to grow from current position to a high position in your company.
Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best Regards.
