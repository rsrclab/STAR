Hi, When I saw "ERC-721 ERC-20" in your job description, I'm confident to be the best candidate.
It's my last defi project which use works on fantom network. 
https://2omb.finance/: It's defi platform which provides tokens and liquidity pool to fantom Network.
Accounts can stake, swap and borrow tokens through the liquidity pool.
These contracts are built by solidity (version 0.6.12) and deployed on the Fantom network.
Please let me know if you want to ask some questions.
Best Regards.
